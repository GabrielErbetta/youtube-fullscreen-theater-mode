# Youtube Simple Theater
Browser extension that makes YouTube theater mode fullscreen.
I tried some extensions that did the same but none of them felt perfect to me so i made my own.

But check out my inspirations [Better YouTube Theatre Mode](https://github.com/SimenMH/better-youtube-theatre-mode) and [YouTube Livestreams Theater Mode](https://napalighost.com/youtube-livestreams-theater-mode).
