# YouTube Fullscreen Theater Mode
Browser extension that makes YouTube theater mode fullscreen. You can find it in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-simple-theater/chdopbgfclideohjmcddafojdmfncjdp) and in [Firefox Browser Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yt-fullscreen-theater-mode/).

I tried some extensions that did the same but none of them felt perfect to me so i made my own.
But check out my inspirations [Better YouTube Theatre Mode](https://github.com/SimenMH/better-youtube-theatre-mode) and [YouTube Livestreams Theater Mode](https://napalighost.com/youtube-livestreams-theater-mode).

- Page is scrolled to hide the YouTube header
- Chat is also resized to occupy the entire height
- Doesn't change the page when theater mode is disabled
